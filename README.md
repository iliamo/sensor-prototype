Description
----

NDN-based Sensor Project using Consumer/Producer API. 

Project contains two kinds of producers and consumers. 

The CPU-Sensor Producer keeps detecting the CPU temperatrue every 60 seconds and writing it into repo-ng, which is the NDN repository. The consumer can consume the Name(like /ndn/ucla/cpu/temp) to get the latest CPU temperatrue from the repo.

The Light-Control Consumer can send the command(inside the interest with consumers' signature) to control the screen light of the Producer. Producer will verify the interest, run the control command if signature proved and return the sucessful status to the Consumer with producers' signature. If verification failed, Producer would return NACK with NO-DATA signal to the Consumer. Consumer could check the status it gets from the Producer and verify the signatureã€‚
